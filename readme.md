<h1>Right-wing Lies and Liars</h1>

<p>Ronald Reagan was a saint, a commanding leader, the gold standard of principled 
conservatism against whom all current and future Republicans should be measured. 
This is the new mantra coming out of the Republican race for the presidency as the 
current crop of candidates scramble, quite understandably, to distance themselves 
from the walking disaster that is George W. Bush.

The canonization of Ronald Reagan rests crucially on one thing Reagan himself did 
well: forgetting the facts. It seems timely to exhume a few.
In the Fox News-hosted ​“debate” among the Republican hopefuls, Ron Paul, Rudi 
Giuliani and others were quick to wrap themselves in the Reagan mantle. When 
Fred Thompson – actor turned politician – entered the race, he evoked huge sighs of 
relief among Republicans, who see him as the one best able to recapture the Gipper’s 
magic. Coincidentally, Reagan’s diaries, edited by Douglas Brinkley, have just been 
published and also seek to cast him as ​“a true American leader”.

While much of the neocon agenda is in tatters right now, certainly one of its most 
successful achievements has been the canonization of Ronald Reagan, which rests 
crucially on one thing Reagan himself did so well: forgetting the facts. So it’s 
time to exhume a few.

First to go is the myth that Reagan was the most popular president since FDR. 
Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting reminds us, ​“During the first two years of 
Reagan’s presidency, the public was giving President Reagan the lowest level of 
approval of all modern elected presidents. Reagan’s average first-year approval 
rating was 58 percent – lower than Dwight Eisenhower’s 69 percent, Jack Kennedy’s 
75 percent, Richard Nixon’s 61 percent and Jimmy Carter’s 62 percent.” At the 
end of his second year, (remember the Reagan recession?) Reagan’s approval 
rating was 41 percent; after the Iran-Contra scandal was revealed, Reagan’s 
approval rating stood at 46 percent. His approval rating for his entire 
presidency was lower than Kennedy’s, Eisenhower’s and even Johnson’s, and at 
times he was one of the most unpopular presidents in recent history.

Also forgotten is Reagan’s own embarrassing propensity to just make things up. 
Reagan was a dunce and a fabricator. One of his most famous assertions was, ​
“Trees cause more pollution than automobiles do,” and he maintained, wrongly, 
that sulfur dioxide emitted from Mount St. Helens was greater than that 
emitted by cars over a 10-year period. (In one day, cars emit 40 times what 
Mount St. Helens released in a day even at its peak activity.) In 1985, 
Reagan praised the P.W. Botha’s apartheid regime of South Africa for 
eliminating segregation, a blunder then-Press Secretary Larry Speakes had 
to correct a few days later. 

Other examples abound: During a 1983 Congressional Medal of Honor ceremony 
Reagan told a story about military heroism that New York Daily News columnist 
Lars-Erik Nelson wrote never happened. Nelson had checked the citations on all 
434 Congressional Medals of Honor awarded during WWII. The scene Reagan 
described did appear, however, in the 1944 film A Wing and a Prayer. Larry 
Speakes’ response? ​“If you tell the same story five times, it’s true.” 

And let’s not forget the wages of ​“trickle down” economics and ​“Reaganomics,” 
from which we have still not recovered. In 1982, the Congressional Budget 
Office found that taxpayers earning under $10,000 lost an average of $240 
from Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts, while those earning more than $80,000 gained 
an average of $15,130. By that fall, the jobless rate hit 10.1 percent – the 
worst in 42 years, and a year later 11.9 million were out of work. In 1983, 
the country’s poverty rate rose to 15 percent, the highest level since the 
mid-’60s. In 1984, a congressional study reported that cuts in welfare had 
pushed more than 500,000 people – the majority of them children – into poverty. 
Then-Attorney General Ed Meese’s response? ​“I don’t know of any authoritative 
figures that there are hungry children … people go to soup kitchens because 
the food is free and that’s easier than paying for it.”

The neocons would have us believe that Reagan was also a foreign policy 
genius. Space prevents me from detailing his administration’s adventures 
and blunders in Grenada, in Beirut and the visit to the Nazi cemetery in 
Bitburg. So let’s just remember aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, whom 
Reagan likened to the Founding Fathers, and the revelation that the CIA 
had produced a manual that taught them, in part, how to kidnap and ​
“neutralize” government officials. Iran-Contra – the secret and illegal 
selling of weapons to our sworn enemy, Iran, to then fund the Contras – 
was both a constitutional disaster and a foreign policy blunder about 
which we were asked to believe Reagan knew nothing. His administration 
was also thoroughly corrupt: Eight senior officials in his administration 
were indicted.

Fabrication, lying, cruel and counterproductive policies at home and abroad, 
bloating of the deficit, widening the gap between rich and poor: These are the 
Reagan legacy. As Republican candidates seek to wear his mantle, their Democratic 
opponents need to remind Americans exactly what they are putting on.
